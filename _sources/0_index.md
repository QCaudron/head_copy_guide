# A Guide to Head Copy

This

The next few chapters of this guide are dedicated to addressing some of the main pain points encountered when learning to head copy. In [Chapter 2, Recognising the code](./2_recognition), we look at the speeds at which we should learn to head copy, as well as instant character and word recognition. It also deals with _anticipation_ and how it can be both a help and a hindrance. [Chapter 3, Focus](./3_focus) discusses concentration for head copying CW, and how to find your state of _flow_ in order to copy while reducing both the impact of errors and the tiredness that comes with long bouts of concentration. Then, in [Chapter 4, Buffer](./4_buffer), we look at how to actually remember what was copied, and form it into coherent thoughts and sentiments without remembering what was sent verbatim.

[Chapter 5, Methods](./5_methods) deals with some of the different mental methods that people use to copy code in their heads.
