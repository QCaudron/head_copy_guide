# Focus and the "rails"

For me, concentration is a delicate thing, when head copying. There's a delicate balance to be struck, a mid-point between focusing too little, and too much.

A loose focus may have you easily distracted, and you may lose some of the thread of what you've been copying so far. Your instant character recognition may not be as fast as you need, and you will lose your flow.

Believe it or not, it's also easy to over-focus on the code as you hear it. Focus too hard, and if you make a mistake, you will "fall" hard; it will take you significant time to get back into the swing of things (this is where frustration can seep in and become a real hindrance to progress). Strong concentration is also mentally taxing, and you'll find yourself unable to copy before too long.

## The rails

I like to refer to this balancing act as "being on the rails". Falling off the rails is highly disruptive, and it takes time to get back up and moving.

Forgive yourself

## Keeping your momentum

## Armchair copy

## On the importance of uniformity

- Uniformity is important -- more stable on the rails; you can't control this but it explains why you can't copy bad fists
- Returning to the rails after falling
- A state of "flow", "armchair copy"
- You can focus too little and too much
- Listen while distracted -- Howard's class
