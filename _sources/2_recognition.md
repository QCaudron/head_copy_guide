# Recognising the code

## Speed

- Slower is not always better
- But fast speeds require head copy

## Instant character recognition

- The first ceiling on your ability to head-copy is ICR
- Use a speed of at least 20 character speed, 25+ is better
- Get to a point where it's muscle memory : hear something, write or know the letter
- Underscores, dropping letters and moving on; stay on the rails or get up quickly

## Instant word recognition

- Maybe a misnomer
- Before IWR, hearing common prefixes, suffixes
- Many common short words, Q-code, prosigns worth knowing
- Abbreviations are very helpful

## Anticipation

- Anticipation as tree-search
- Can trip you up so be ready to pivot
- Context is king
