This

## Breakdown

We start with some general thoughts on getting started with head copy. {numref}`chapter:getting_started` 

The next few sections of this guide are dedicated to addressing some of the main pain points encountered when learning to head copy. In {numref}`chapter:recognition`, we look at how to recognise what you hear, from individuals characters to words, as well as how speed and spacing affects your copy and how anticipation can be both a help and a hindrance. {numref}`chapter:focus` discusses concentration for head copying CW, and how to find your state of flow in order to copy while reducing both the impact of errors and the tiredness that comes with long bouts of concentration. Then, in {numref}`chapter:buffer`, we look at how to actually remember what was copied, and form it into coherent thoughts and sentiments without remembering what was sent word for word.

{numref}`chapter:methods` deals with some of the different mental methods that people use to copy code in their heads. We look at visual and auditory methods, and compare with how we understand spoken conversation.

In {numref}`chapter:head_sending`, we flip the picture and discuss how you can help the person on the other side of the key with clean sending from the top of your head.
