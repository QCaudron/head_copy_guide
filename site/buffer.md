# The buffer, memory, and making sense of things

A common complaint of those learning to head copy is that of memory : _"I copied it all, but I immediately forgot"_, or _"I got the first few words and then got overwhelmed and everything went away."_

- We can hold some amount of words in our heads
- However it's better to distill the info and not remember the words
- Visual methods may impose more buffer limitation; K1IG talk
- Let's have a conversation; we don't remember each other's exact words
