# Acknowledgements

If I've come a long way in my CW journey, it's thanks to some wonderful people who taught me, supported me, and trusted in me.

I'd like to extend my thanks to many at the [Long Island CW Club](http://www.longislandcwclub.org), a great organisation that continues to impress. The LICW has an incredibly supportive community of students and instructors, and continues to innovate in how CW is taught, all over the world.

My special thanks go to some great humans :

- Terry WB0JRH, for pushing me well past where I thought I was capable
- John W2JSJ, for bridging that delicate area between 10 and 20 wpm
- Mike N1CC and Bob WO6W, for being great supporters of my ideas
- Tom NV1U (SK), for that feeling of friendly community that we have attempted to continue in your absence
- The many regulars of the NV1U Memorial Class; we have come a very long way together
